# vhol-demo

This is a demo repo to show how easy it is to get setup with dbt continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions.
You should be able to run this self-contained example, use the `yaml` workflow files as template, make some minor changes and have your own dbt project up and running with CI/CD in no time.
